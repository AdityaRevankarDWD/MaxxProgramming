        <img src="img.jpg">
        <p class="pn"> Programming is writing computer code to create a program, to solve a problem.
            Programs are created to implement algorithms.
             Algorithms can be represented as pseudocode or a flowchart,and programming is
              the translation of these into a computer program.</p>
                <a href="project 2.html">Algorithms</a> 
        <p>A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.</p>
        <a href="project 4.html">Pseudocode</a>   
        <p>A detailed yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm should do.</p>
        <a href="project 6.html">Flowchart</a>    
        <p>A flowchart is a picture of the separate steps of a process in sequential order.</p>
